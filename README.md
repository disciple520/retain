# retain

This application is in its infancy right now. I hope to build it into something that is very useful for me and others that desire to not only read (and watch) non-fiction materials, but to make a way to review and thereby retain that information so it is useful to ourselves and others long after we have read it.

This project is also a way for me to increase my skill with objective-C and learn the testing framework that Xcode offers. 

Check out the screenshots folder to see the user interface.
